This C# program serves as a menu-driven executor for running other C# programs. It presents a menu of programs to choose from and executes the selected program. The user can select a program from the menu by entering the corresponding number. The program then launches the selected program as a separate process.

Features:

Menu Display: The program displays a menu of available programs along with their descriptions.
Program Execution: Executes the selected program by invoking its executable file.
Graceful Termination: Allows the user to exit the menu loop and terminate the program.

Usage:

Compile Programs: Ensure that the programs listed in the menu are compiled and their executable files are present in the same directory as this program.
Run Program: Execute the compiled Program.exe file to launch the menu.

Select Program: Choose a program from the menu by entering its corresponding number.

View Output: View the output of the selected program in the console window.
